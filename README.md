# 📘 Class 2 – Links, Images, Lists & More

In this class, we learned **how to connect pages, insert images, and structure content** with HTML.

---

## 1. `<a>` – Anchor Tag (Links)

Used to create **links** between pages or websites.

```html
<a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a>
<a href="/about.html">About Page</a>
href → Where to go.

target="_blank" → Opens in new tab.

🔗 Analogy: Like a door.

href = address of the room.

target="_blank" = whether you enter through a new door (new tab).

## **2.** Internal Links (#id)

Jump to a section in the same page.

<a href="#edu">Go to Education</a>

<h2 id="edu">Education</h2>


📖 Analogy: Like a bookmark inside a book.


## **3**. Navigation Between Pages
<!-- index.html -->
<a href="/about.html">About</a>

<!-- about.html -->
<a href="/index.html">Home</a>


🏠 Analogy: Like going from Home page to About page in a website.
